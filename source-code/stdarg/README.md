# Stdarg

C functions can have variadic arguments, i.e., functions that can be called with
a variable number of arguments.  Note that the function needs to implicitely or
explicitely know the number of arguments, there is no mechanism to determine this
at runtime.


## What is it?

1. `sum_all.c`: example of a function with variadic arguments.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applications.

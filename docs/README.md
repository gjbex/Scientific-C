C is widely used in many contexts.
This training focusses on using C for scientific programming.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will be able to

  * read and understand well-written C code;
  * write intermediate-level C programs;
  * have a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the more
    sophisticated aspects of C;
  * know about best practices and pitfalls for C programmers;
  * have a working knowledge of the C standard Library;
  * know how to use third-party libraries such as GSL for numerical
    computing.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Scientific-C/), as well as example code
and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use C as a programming
language.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in another programming language,
This is not a training that starts from scratch.

If you plan to do C programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.

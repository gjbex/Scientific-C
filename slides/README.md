# Slides
Slides for computational physics course.

Slides on programming in C are heavily based on Kernighan & Ritchie (1989)
The C programming language, Prentice Hall.

## What is it?
1. `introduction.pptx`: introduction to computation using a von Neuman
    model of computation.
1. `overview.pptx`: a bird's eye view of the C programming language.
    Material covers the first chapter of K&R.
1. `types_operators.pptx`: detailed overview of types in C, and of its
    operators.  Covers most of the material in the second chapter of K&R.
1. `control_flow.pptx`: detailed overview of control flow statements in C.
    Covers most of the material in the third chapter of K&R.
1. `functions.pptx`: detailed overview of C functions, variable scope
    rules and program structure. The C preprocessor and the compilation
    and linking aer mentions, as well as assertions.  Covers most of the
    material in the fourth chapter of K&R.
1. `pointers.pptx`: detailed overview of pointers with motivating examples
    such as simulating call by reference, passing structuress to functions.
    Dynamic memory allocation is discussed, as well as the relationship
    between pointers and arrays.  Covers most of the material in the fifth
    chapter of K&R.
